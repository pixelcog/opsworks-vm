Packer templates for AWS OpsWorks
=================================

This repository contains a [Packer](https://www.packer.io) templates for Ubuntu and CentOS 7 
pre-loaded with the `opsworks-agent` software utilized by Amazon Web Services,
allowing [OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) stacks to be virtualized
for local testing and development.

This Packer configuration will install the `opsworks-agent-cli` command and
daemon and bundle the resulting Vagrant box with a custom shell script
provisioner to interface with it, manage dependencies, and simplify deployments.

## Building and Installation

```bash
$ rake build    # create a 'ubuntu1404-opsworks' box
$ rake install  # install a compiled box via 'vagrant box add'
$ rake remove   # remove an installed box via 'vagrant box remove'
```

By default, these will build a VirtualBox compatible Vagrant image. If you wish
to create a box for VMWare, you can prefix the commands like so:

```bash
$ rake vmware:build
```

Rake will build a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS "*Trusty Tahr*" box by default, but you can
also specify Ubuntu 12.04 LTS "*Precise Pangolin*" or CentOS 7 LTS mini like so:

```bash
$ rake build[ubuntu1204] install[ubuntu1204]
or
$ rake build[centos7mini] install[centos7mini]
```

_**Note:** Amazon Linux is not supported as it cannot be run outside of
Amazon EC2. But the CentOS 7 build is very close to a Amazon Linux._


## Using the Box

The compiled box will be named `ubuntu1404-opsworks` or `ubuntu1204-opsworks` or `centos7mini-opsworks`.
To utilize this box in your project, create a new Vagrantfile and include
the following:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu1404-opsworks"
  config.vm.provision "opsworks", type:"shell", args:"path/to/dna.json"
end
```

The argument passed to the _opsworks_ provisioner should be a path relative to
the Vagrantfile which contains the JSON to be used by chef-zero. If multiple
arguments are provided, the JSON documents will be merged with the entries in
the later files overriding the earlier ones.  This can be useful when
provisioning a multi-machine stack where parts of the configuration are shared
between machines. You can see an example of this in the [_example_](example/)
directory.

An example JSON file might look like the following:

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "my-app": {
      "application_type": "php",
      "scm": {
        "scm_type": "git",
        "repository": "path/to/my-app"
      }
    }
  },
  "opsworks_custom_cookbooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "scm": {
      "repository": "path/to/my-cookbooks"
    },
    "recipes": [
      "recipe[opsworks_initial_setup]",
      "recipe[dependencies]",
      "recipe[mod_php5_apache2]",
      "recipe[deploy::default]",
      "recipe[deploy::php]",
      "recipe[my_custom_cookbook::configure]"
    ]
  }
}
```

Where `path/to/my-app` and `path/to/my-cookbooks` are paths relative to the
Vagrantfile.  These will be copied into the vm and deployed as though they
were remote git repositories.  If you include a _Berksfile_ in your custom
cookbooks then berkshelf will be enabled automatically.
